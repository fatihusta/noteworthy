- Take ownership of your online identity by assuming authority over YOUR online accounts and all associated metadata. (SSI, SSO with Gluu, Keycloak, etc)
- Communicate freely and privately online without the need for centralized messaging providers such as Signal or Whatsapp (Matrix, Jitsi, Mumble)
- Export your email from Gmail, Hotmail, Yahoo, etc to a personal email server not hosted in the cloud (Mail-in-a-box)
- Migrate away from cloud storage by collaborating with friends and family to store personal data (photos, videos, music etc) easily, effeciecntly and reliably across the devices and computers you already own.
